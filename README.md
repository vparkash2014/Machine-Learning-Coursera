# Machine Learning-Coursera

The purpose of this is repository is to share the code I have written and build upon the skills I have learned through a Machine Learning specialization course I am taking on Coursera. 

To respect the instructors' wishes and detract cheaters, I have purposely did not included the name of the courses and the instructors. (Though I will like to acknowledge the high quality of videos and instructions they have provided). I have reformatted the assignments and excluded key information such as the data. 

If you have any questions or suggestions on how can improve my scripts, please feel free to contact me. I am always open to suggestions and love to have a chat.
